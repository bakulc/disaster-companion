After a disaster, most of the means of communication get blocked or are very busy creating bottlenecks in the communication
channel. Moreover, various people are trapped or need some supplies and hence need to contact and share their information to rescue 
operations. We will make an app, that will rely on mobile's GPS and  to find location of the user's phone and send it via 
messaging. We choose messaging as its often available when the phone lines get overloaded. Many articles and comments of people who 
had experienced disasters, suggested that text-messaging is often free and available after a disaster when other lines are jammed.


So, we will include an option to send the user's coordinate to a given number along with translated the location with help of a cached map service. The options available to send this info would be text-messaging or calling if available. 
The app will have two modes of operation. One for rescue operations and another for victims. The victims will be able to send their locations to a number they specify and then the rescue operations will be able to visualise their locations in the map cached by the app. Further, we will include all necessary protocols and precautions to inform the citizens, what to do when a disaster strikes in an easy to follow way.
